# Imaging sky scene with High Dynamic Range (HDR) captures

With the spirit of reproducible research, this repository contains all the codes required to produce the results in the manuscript: S. Dev, F. M. Savoy, Y. H. Lee, S. Winkler, Design of low-cost, compact and weather-proof whole sky imagers for high-dynamic-range captures, *Proc. IEEE International Geoscience and Remote Sensing Symposium (IGARSS)*, July 2015. 

Please cite the above paper if you intend to use whole/part of the code. This code is only for academic and research purposes.

## Code Organization
All codes are written in MATLAB. Most of the HDR imaging codes are adapted from Marc Alexa's HDR implementation [page](http://cybertron.cg.tu-berlin.de/eitz/hdr/).

### Reproducibility 
The program `main.m` is the main script, that reproduces all the results. It uses different helper scripts stored in the folder `scripts`. It also reproduces the figures in this associated paper.
